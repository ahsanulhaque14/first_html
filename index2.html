    <h1>What is html</h1>
    <p><ins>HTML</ins>, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a set of elements or tags that define different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

        Key points about HTML include:
        
        1. **Structure:** HTML defines the basic structure of web documents, consisting of elements enclosed in tags. Tags are typically written in angle brackets `< >`.
        
        2. **Elements:** Elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Each element represents different types of content and can contain attributes that provide additional information about an element.
        
        3. **Attributes:** Attributes provide additional information about elements and are written within the opening tag of an element. They typically consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign.
        
        4. **Semantics:** HTML includes semantic elements that describe the meaning of their content, making it easier for web browsers, search engines, and developers to understand the structure of a webpage.
        
        5. **Versioning:** HTML has evolved over time, with different versions such as HTML4, XHTML, HTML5, and newer iterations, each introducing new features, enhancements, and improvements.
        
        6. **Browser Rendering:** Web browsers interpret HTML <b>code</b> to display web pages according to the instructions provided by the HTML structure and content.
        
        HTML is often used alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the core technologies for building and designing websites and web applications..</p>
